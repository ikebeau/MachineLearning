# Model Types {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## Supervised Learning: {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Benefits:

Clear Objectives: Suitable when the task involves clear predictions or classifications with labeled data, such as image recognition or spam detection.

Feedback Mechanism: When continuous improvement and adjustment based on explicit feedback are crucial, supervised learning is the preferred choice.

Well-understood Performance Metrics: Ideal when well-defined metrics like accuracy or precision are necessary for assessing model performance.

Broad Applicability: Appropriate for a wide range of tasks where input-output relationships can be learned from labeled data.

Availability of Diverse Algorithms: Choose supervised learning when there is a need for flexibility in selecting algorithms tailored to specific problems.

### Common Models:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests

## Unsupervised Learning: {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Benefits:

Discovery of Patterns: Optimal when the goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data without predefined labels.

Data Exploration: Useful for exploring datasets without clear labels, enabling insights and potential feature engineering for future supervised learning tasks.

Anomaly Detection: Suitable for identifying anomalies or outliers within the data without relying on labeled examples.

Clustering: When the objective is to organize similar data points into groups, unsupervised learning through clustering is the method of choice.

Reduced Dependency on Labeled Data: Prefer unsupervised learning when labeled data is scarce or unavailable.

### Common Models:

K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

## Reinforcement Learning: {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Benefits:

Sequential Decision Making: Appropriate for scenarios involving sequential decision-making, where actions impact future states.

Adaptability: Use reinforcement learning when the model needs to learn and adapt its behavior based on feedback received through rewards or penalties.

Simulation Environments: Ideal for training in simulated environments, allowing for safe exploration and learning without real-world consequences.

Complex Strategies: When the task requires learning complex strategies and policies for optimal decision-making, reinforcement learning is the preferred choice.

Autonomy: Choose reinforcement learning when autonomy is crucial, and the model needs to operate independently in dynamic and changing environments.
